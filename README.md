##What is the Roots Network?
Roots is an informationally dense, no bs system for organizing, saving, and sharing hyperlinks. Roots is a system for sharing the highest concentration of value in the simplest form.


##Why is the Roots Network Important?
The hyperlink is a fundamental concept of the internet.  Therefore the organization of hyperlinks is essential to a healthy and productive internet--which is why websites such as Google and Reddit have become massively high value portals to the information available on the web. Roots Network is an informationally dense and designed system for sharing the essence of value and information; a brutalist organization of hyperlinks.  Instagram has popularized the sharing of images, Roots will popularize the advanced organization, sharing, and subscribing to lists of links to categorically organized, high value content.

Brian Norgard, The "architect of the top grossing app in the world", tweeted that feeds are dead and private/group communication will be the next communication paradigm.  Roots Network supports this paradigm of high value private communication of value via hyperlinks.

##How is it built

The application currently uses Vue.js for view/model creation and stores the list of links in localstorage.  I hope to add 0auth user registration and a more comprehensive backend soon.

I greatly appreciate any pull requests and help with development! Please feel free to reach out to collaborate on this project with me. `Dylanrboudro@gmail.com`
